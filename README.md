# Employee Layoff Risk Prediction

This project builds a predictive model to identify the risk of employee layoffs using HR analytics data. The objective is to assist HR teams in identifying at-risk employees and planning proactive retention strategies.

## 📊 Overview
- Used PCA to reduce feature dimensionality and improve model efficiency.
- Trained and compared multiple models: LDA, Logistic Regression, K-Means Clustering, and Bagging.
- Achieved up to **91% accuracy** in predicting layoff risk.
- Proposed a recommendation system to segment employees by risk tier.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset (publicly available on Kaggle)
- Contains employee demographic, performance, and job satisfaction data.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, TensorFlow
- Dimensionality Reduction: PCA
- Classification Models: LDA, Logistic Regression, Bagging
- Unsupervised Learning: K-Means Clustering

## 🚀 Results
- PCA improved training time without sacrificing accuracy.
- Bagging outperformed other models on predictive performance.
- The recommendation system offers HR-friendly groupings for intervention.

## 🧠 Potential Applications
- Early warning system for workforce attrition
- Skill development targeting based on risk groups
- Performance or engagement-based resource planning
